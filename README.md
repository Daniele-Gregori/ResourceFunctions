# Resource-Functions
Here I collect the Resource Functions I developed for the [Wolfram Function Repository](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/):

* [ODENormalForm](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/ODENormalForm/): transform a differential equation into normal form;

* [TransformTabular](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/TransformTabular/): transform simultaneously all columns of a tabular or a selection of them;

* [ComplexRange](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/ComplexRange/): generate a range of complex numbers;

* [FindClosedForm](https://resources.wolframcloud.com/FunctionRepository/resources/FindClosedForm/): search for a formula that yields a given number.

To see their documentation, click the corresponding links.

The most important one, FindClosedForm, is also in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Daniele-Gregori/FindClosedForm).
